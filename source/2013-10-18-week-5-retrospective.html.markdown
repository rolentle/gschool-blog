####Lightening Talk

I have also been working on a lightening talk this week which has taken precedent for me. The talk is focused around Yehuda Katz and the Merb/Rails Merge. Researching Merb, Rails, and their coorosponding design philosophies has helped me become a better programmer thinking about how I make decisions in my code. Also, this talk gave me the opportunity to learn more about ember.js, the client side and their advantages and disadavantages.

The ligthening talk also provides another avenue for students to show off their talents other than coding. It also helps break up the work flow from daily routine of programming. The Jumpstart Lab team understand that being a programmer is more than just one's ability to code, but their ability to communicate as well. Having the skill to confidently and passionately speak in from of your peers for five minute can add move value than you coding capabilities.
