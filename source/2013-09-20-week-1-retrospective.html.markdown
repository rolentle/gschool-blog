####EventReporter

This week, we created a command line tool that took in CSVs and  was able to do the following:

* load CSVs
* Reteive data by selected criteria
* Sort the CSV data by columns
* Print an output to the terminal
* Save to CSV
* Create a help functionality of valid commands for the program
* Create a command line interface to accept commands to do the prior features

####Work Patterns

I worked on this project over a four day period from 8am to 8pm each day, excluding mandatory class time of around four hours a day. Given these hours, I found it crucial to stay to a strict [pomodoro routine](http://pomodorotechnique.com/), working in 25 minute burst with five minute breaks. This prevented me from getting exhausted by forcing myself to take break, allowing me to regroup and focus periodically. I know in most situations, people are not able to dictate their work flow. However, I was working on my own which allowed to stay on this schedule.

Working alone has the main benefit of being able to move quickly, yet there are downsides such as a lack of focus, a single set of opinions, and lack of readable code. I started off this project testing everything I was writing, however as the deadline quickly approached I opted to stop testing for the sake of more features in my projects. In retrospect, this is a decision I regret,not only disregarding best practices, but philosophically chasing after the quick win opposed to staying the course. I believe if I had a partner on this project, he or she would have kept me honest and we would have been more disciplined about testing. Choosing more features versus better code is a challenge many developers face on a daily basis, so I am glad I learned how this felt now to prepare me for the future.

####Reflection

I was able to meet all the feature requirements, even though the code was untested, an oversight I will make sure doesn't happen in future projects. However, after reviewing my code with other students, I realized my classes were doing too much. This begs questions such as: When do you create new class? How do you bucket responsibility to classes accordingly? Does this method fall within this class's scope? These questions are what make programming more of an art than a science. Thinking about how and why  code is structured is the biggest thing I am excited to learn about.
