###IdeaBox
This week's Project was IdeaBox, a basic web CMS that stored ideas a user create using the Sinatra Framework. Having created Sinatra apps before, this was a great refresher on working with the web. Because Sinatra is very simple, compared to Rails, I was forced to think about how I need to structure my app since there was nothing already done for me. Being able to create a CMS tool from scratch this early in the program has given me a lot of confindence on what I can build 4 months from now at the end of the program. Most applications are just deveritives of some CMS so doing this project helped me better understand how to think about how other apps are built.

IdeaBox was my first test driven web app and pushed me to better understand acceptance testing. This was most important learning goal for me during this project. I wanted to make sure that my app is well tested which would also give me a better understand testing techinques and tools such as Capybara. Pushing myself to test more has made more results focused worrying  less about implementation. Writing tests creates scenarios that only ask for code to work and is agnostic to how it works. This workflow has reduced my anxiety/stress when working because I no longer get caught up in the details of my code, knowing that my tests will guide me.

My only regret on this project was not having a well designed front-end. To the user, the front end is the app. No matter how proud I am of my code or how well it is tested. If the app does not create an enjoyable user experience, the app is failure. This is a major disconnect between business owners and developers, business owners are focused on how to continiously drive value to the user, while developers want to build sustainable applications. This is not say developers don't care about users, or business owners do not care about sustainability. It is a matter of priority to each person.


###Non-Sequeter: Code Retreat

gSchool[1] had its first code retreat this weekend at [The Soure](https://www.facebook.com/thesourcedenver). During the code retreat, we worked on the same problem multiple times but each time we we would have a different partner and a different constraint. For example, we would have one partner and were not able to speak to each other, then on the next iteration with a new partner, we could not write methods longer than 5 lines long. I enjoyed the retreat because I got to code with people in the class that I didn't normally get to code with on a daily basis. My only criticism of the retreat was I would have liked to had fewer but longer sessions because many times during  a pairing, we spent half the time, getting back to the place we were before.
