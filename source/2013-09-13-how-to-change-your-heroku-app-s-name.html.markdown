Are you tired of weirdly autogenerated named Heroku apps like [tranquility-ponds-7681.herokuapp.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4)? Are looking for an app make over your app [xcool-dude-87x.herokuapp.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4) to something more professional sounding? In three easy steps you can change your Heroku app's name

##### Step 1: Go To Your App Root Folder

In your terminal, go to the root folder of your Heroku app. This will be where you initialize ran `heroku create`.

```bash
$ cd path/to/the/root/of/your/app
```

##### Step 2: Change The Name of Your App

Now that you are in your root folder. Type in the following line in your terminal. Make `the-name-you-want` the name that you want.

```bash
$ heroku rename:apps the-name-you-want
```
**Protip:** *Heroku App Name Restrictions*

Because the name becomes part of the url, Heroku app names can only consist of:

* lowercase letters
* numbers
* dashes

#### Step 3: Checkout Your Newly Named App

Now that you have changed the name of your Heroku app, go to the new url of your app i.e. [the-name-you-want.herokuapp.com](the-name-you-want.herokuapp.com)

**Protip:** `heroku rename:apps` *Also Changes Your Git Repo*

When you change the name of your Heroku app, it will also change your Heroku git repo. As the following:

```bash
git@heroku.com:oldname.git => git@heroku.com:newname.git
```

#### Conclusion
Changing the name is a pretty simple process by doing previous mentioned steps. If you would like further documentation, see the offical [Heroku tutorial.](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/renaming-apps)
